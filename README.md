# Bio
I'm currently a Master's student at Stony Brook University where I'm majoring in Applied Math and Statistics with Special focus on Optimization and Operations Research.

I've worked with Factspan Inc for 2.5 years where I supported fortune 500 companies in their Analytics, and Data engineering requirements. I've experience working with Retail and Hospitality industry data.

I also have an interest in writing fantasy fiction, worldbuilding and conlanging.
