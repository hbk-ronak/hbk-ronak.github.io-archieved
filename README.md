# Bio
I'm currently a Master's student at Stony Brook University where I'm majoring in Applied Math and Statistics with Special focus on Optimization and Operations Research and actively looking for internship opportunities in Data Science, Analytics, Operations Research, Machine Learning, Data Engineering and Quantitative Trading.

I've worked with Factspan Inc for 2.5 years where I supported fortune 500 companies in their Analytics, and Data engineering requirements. I've experience working with Retail and Hospitality industry data.

You can find my updated resume [here](/Resume_Generic.pdf)

I also have an interest in writing [Fantasy Fiction](https://blog.ronakshah.xyz), worldbuilding and [Conlanging](https://hbk-ronak.github.io/conlang/). I've also created a card game that can be played with a standard deck of 52 cards. [Nexus](https://hbk-ronak.github.io/nexuscardgame/) The game is set in the Fantasy world I created. You can also check a related Board game called [Battle Lanes](https://hbk-ronak.github.io/battlelanes/)
